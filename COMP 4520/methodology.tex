\section{Methodology}


In this section, we will first show the details of the supervised InfNet for imaging segmentation (baseline) model that we will be comparing with including the network architecture, the data preprocessing steps, and the loss function. We will then show our proposed methods using self-supervised learning and how it helps to improve generalisation and performance of the model while having a limited number of data samples. We will also show the extension of our data preprocessing steps which further improves the performance of our model.

\subsection{Supervised InfNet for imaging segmentation}
Supervised InfNet	(Lung Infection Segmentation Network) will be used as our baseline to compare without using any semi-supervised learning algorithm. This is to show that the self-supervised learning method  improves the performance of the baseline supervised learning InfNet for imaging segmentation. We will extend our work on supervised InfNet by adding self-supervised method to it.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=88mm]{supervised-inf-net.png}
	\caption{The architecture of the supervised InfNet. The CT lung image is first passed into the convolutional layers to extract the features of the CT lung image. Then, the features generated from the convolutional layer are fed into the partial decoder module, reverse attention module and the edge detection module. The edge detection module is to help the network with detection of the boundaries of the segmentation. The reverse attention and the partial decoder generates the segmentation of the infection regions of the CT lung images. }

	\caption{The architecture of the coach network for self-supervised inpainting. The loss for the coach network is constructed from the loss of the image inpainting from the InfNet. The coach network and the InfNet both work together as a MinMax algorithm. The InfNet will try and minimize the loss to generate better image inpainting while the coach network will try to increase the loss of the image inpainting through generating more complex masks. In the beginning, the masks generated by the coach network will be less complex. Through training of the coach network, as the InfNet gets better at predicting image inpainting, the coach network generates a more complex masks.}

	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{self-super-inf-net.png}
	\caption{The architecture of our self-supervised InfNet model. The original InfNet model would generate 5 different predictions: the edge segmentation prediction, and the other 4 are segmentation of the infected regions but of different sizes. In order to utilise the ability of self-supervised method for InfNet segmentation, we generate masks to be fed into the InfNet model. The last layer for each output prediction is not used for the self-supervised case. However, the last layer is replace with a different layer to reconstruct the image and the edge appropriately. Everything else is kept the same as the InfNet architecture. This way the network will learn meaningful representations of the CT images and we can use these meaningful representations to learn the segmentation of the infected regions of the CT lung images. After learning the self-supervised features for InfNet, the training continues as normal similar to the InfNet algorithm. The training will start with the weights trained using the self-supervised inpainting method. The last layer will be changed to its original layer instead of the replaced convolutional layer. }

\begin{figure*}

	\includegraphics[width=100mm]{self-super-multi-inf-net.png}
	\caption{The architecture of our self-supervised multi segmentation InfNet model. Similar to the supervised version of multiple InfNet, we use the same network weights and architectures. However, the last layer of the multiple segmentation InfNet is replace with a linear activation layer to predict the inpainting for the CT images. After the self-supervised InfNet has been trained, we will train the multiple segmentation for multiple segmentation InfNet using the weights of the self-supervised InfNet.  The last layer however will be changed to its original form instead of using the replaced linear activation layer.  This way, all the network weights are loaded from the self-supervised version except for the last layer.}

\end{figure*}

We will not change the structure of the InfNet model and use the default parameters as included in their GitHub code. There will be two different types of the InfNet model. The first one will create a single-labeled segmentation of the image for the infected region. This model predicts as true of the region is either ground-glass opacities or consolidations. This will act as a prior to be fed into the multple-labeled segmentation model concatenate with the original CT image as proposed by the author of InfNet. The multiple-labeled segmentation model will be used to predict the background, ground-glass opacities, and consolidations for the infected region. The multiple-labeled segmentation model will give each of the label a different value instead of grouping them as one as what the single-segmentation model does. 

\subsection{Self-supervised InfNet for imaging segmentation}

We will propose using a self-supervised method to improve the performance of deep neural networks to create pixel-level segmentation for CT scan for lung images of COVID-19 patients. We will integrate self-supervised inpainting to pre-train our network. Since image inpainting is similarly related to image segmentation, we will integrate the pre-training steps as image inpainting for our image segmentation network. By learning features from Image inpainting, the model can learn more features that are related to image segmentation. As creating mask can be a complex task for the network to learn to inpaint, the mask can either be too complex for the network to start learning or too simple to be able to learn good representations. We will be using a coach network that increases the complexity of the masking of the CT images throughout the training of the network. The mask created will initially be relatively simple, once the network is able to predict the inpainting of the CT images with good performance, the coach will increase the complexity of the masking to reduce the performance of the network, similar to how Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) works. The loss fuction for the coach network is:
\begin{equation}
L_{coach}(x) = 1 - L_{rec}(x\odot M)
\end{equation}

where $M = C(x)$ which is created by the coach network. A constraint is apply to this loss function because the coach network would just create a mask that masks all region because no context information would be present for the network to learn and a maximum loss will be achieved. The constraint is:
\begin{equation}
\hat{B}(x) = B(x) - SORT(B(x))^{k|B(x)} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
M = C(x) = \sigma (\alpha \hat{B}(x))
\end{equation}

The backbone, B, of the coach network has a similar network architecture with the model that inpaints the CT images. SORT(B(x)) sorts the features in descending order over the activation map. k represents the $k^{th}$ elements in the sorted list and k helps to control the fraction of the image to be erased. The region that has scores lesser than the $k^{th}$ element will be erased from the images. If k is 0.75 then 0.75 fraction of the images will not be erased. The score is scaled into a range of [0, 1] using a sigmoid activation function. We keep $\alpha = 1$ while training the coach network.

After the self-supervision training is finished, the single segmentation InfNet and multi segmentation InfNet network would reuse the weights that were trained during self-supervised training to train normally on the segmentation for the infected regions.

The proposed self-supervised single-labeled segmentation InfNet network architecture can be seen in \ref{fig:inf-net_arch}. The last layer for each output prediction is replace to a different linear activation layer. The linear activation layer will re-create the original image that is covered by the masks. 

The proposed self-supervised multi-labeled segmentation InfNet network architecture is shown in \ref{fig:multi-inf-net_arch}. The changes in the architecture for the multi-labeled segmentation InfNet is similar to the single-labeled segmentation InfNet where the last layer of the layer is replace with a different linear actiivation layer to output the inpainting of the original image. 


\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Pseudo code for self-supervised with InfNet}
	\label{alg:self-inf-net}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\STATE \textbf{Input:} $D_{labeled}$ = [($inputImage_1$, $G_{t1}$), ...]
		\FOR {each epoch}
		\FOR{each coach step}
		\STATE mask = M(x)
		\STATE maskedInput = $mask \odot inputImage$
		\STATE $ predictedImage =network(maskedInput), inputImage$
		\STATE $L_{rec} = CrossEntropy(predictedImage, inputImage)$
		\STATE $L_{coach}(x) = 1 - L_{rec}$
		\STATE update coach weights
		\ENDFOR
		\FOR {each network step}
		\STATE $P_{labeled} = Preprocess(D_{labeled})$ // data aug
		\STATE $inpaintingOutput = network(P_{labeled})$
		\STATE $L_{rec} = CrossEntropy(InpaintingOutput, inputImage)$
		\STATE backpropogate and save network weights
		\ENDFOR
		\ENDFOR 
		
		
		\FOR {each batch of $D_{labeled}$:}
		\STATE $P_{labeled}$ = Preprocess ($D_{labeled}$)
		\STATE $trainLoss = train(P_{labeled})$
		\STATE Backpropagate train loss
		\STATE $testLoss = test(P_{labeled})$
		\STATE save model weights, \textit{w}.
		\ENDFOR
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

We will also implement different data augmentation that includes random cropping, rotation, and random cutout to increase the number of available annotated data samples and labels as well as improve the model generalization as the data samples for CT images from COVID-19 can be limited. We will show that proper data augmentation affect the performance of the model by a marginal amount.

The output of the single segmentation InfNet will include the edge of the segmentation and four single-labeled segmentation of the infected region of the CT lung images with different sizes as shown in \ref{fig:supervised-inf-net_arch}. A loss will be calculated for each of the output from the InfNet model. The first loss function is the loss edge, $L_{edge}$ which guides the model in representing better segmentation boundaries. The other loss function is the segmentation loss, ${L_{seg}}$. The segmentation loss combines both the loss of Intersection over Union (IoU) and the binary cross entropy loss. The segmentation loss equation is as follows:
\begin{equation}
L_{seg} = L_{IoU} + \lambda L_{BCE}
\end{equation}

The $\lambda$ is set to 1 for this experiment. The segmentation loss is adapted to all of the ${S_i}$ predicted output where ${S_i}$ are created from $f_i$ such that $i={3,4,5}$. 

The total loss function for the baseline InfNet model is then:
\begin{equation}
L_{total} = L_{seg}(G_t, S_g) + L_{edge} + 	\sum_{i=3}^{5}L_{seg}(G_t, S_i)
\end{equation}

The summation of the loss functions are calculated from the output of the three convolutional layers. $G_t$ refers to the ground truth labels. $S_g$ is the output from the parallel partial decoder to match with the ground truth label.

As for the multiple segmentation infected region InfNet. We also use the default model and hypermaters from the InfNet code. We will however train the network without using any unlabeled images to be used as a supervised version. The CT lung images and prior for the CT lung images are concatenate together before being fed into the multiple segmentation InfNet. The prior is generated from the single segmentation InfNet. The prior would contain the area of the infected region. However, the prior does not contain the labels for ground-glass opacities and consolidations. It just shows the infected regions. The multiple segmentation InfNet will label the CT lung images with background, ground-glass opacities, and consolidations. The architecture for multiple segmentation InfNet can be seen in \ref{fig:multi-inf-net_arch}.

In order to improve the performance of the model and to aid in the generalisation, we  determine to use self-supervised learning to learn good representations of the CT scan of lung images. Self-supervised learning generates auxiliary tasks from the labeled data samples. For instance, when undergoing data augmentation with rotation, we could train the network to predict if the images have been rotated 0 degree, 90 degree, 180 degree to learn representations of the images. 


\subsection{Estimation of Severity of COVID-19 from CT images}
Once the network is able to predict the pixel-level segmentation of the CT scan images, we will determine the severity score of the lung regions through several methods. The severity score of the lungs can be determined by using CT severity score (CT-SS) \cite{ref11}. The score uses lung opacification for extension of the infections in the lungs. CT-SS is an adaptation from the method previously used in patients after severe-acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) \cite{ref10} to describe ground-glass opacity, interstitial opacity, and air trapping. The lungs will be divided into 20 regions, the posterior apical segment of upper left lobe was divided into apical and posterior segmental regions, the anteromedial basal segment of lower left lobe will be divided into anterior and basal segmental regions. For each region, there contain a system attributing scores of 0, 1, 2, either parenchymal opacification involves 0%, less than 50%, or equal to or more than 50%. The CT-SS will calculate the sum of individual scored regions. The final value of CT-SS can range from 0 to 40.

Another method to determine the severity score is to use Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) \cite{ref12}  to evaluate the overlap ratio between the automatically segmented regions by the network and the reference region provided by radiologists. The equation is as follows:

\begin{equation}
DSC(R,S)=\frac{2|R\cap S|}{|R|+|S|}
\end{equation}

Where R refers to the reference region provided by the radiologists and S refers to the automatically segmented regions by the network. $|.|$
is the operator that is used to calculate the number of voxels in a given region.

We will compare our method against supervised and semi-supervised \cite{ref13,ref14} models trained on COVID-19 dataset. For comparing supervised learning, we will compare against the paper \cite{ref13}. We will train and follow using the same network structure but change from supervised learning to self-supervised learning and compare the performance between supervised and self-supervised.

When comparing with the semi-supervised model, we determine that our model is successful if our model is able to reach close to or better than the performance of the semi-supervised model as semi-supervised model is able to obtain a higher amount of data samples by looking at both unannotated and annotated data samples while self-supervised model only have access to the annotated labels. A self-supervised learning method will create its own training annotated labels without any manual human labelling and trained without any unlabeled data samples. We will compare our method’s performance against InfNet \cite{ref14} which uses semi-supervised learning by generating pseudo labels from randomly selected unlabeled CT images.

Our method will be novel compare to the other methods mentioned as our method will be integrating both the segmentation of the CT lung images as well as the calculation of the severity score through caluclation of the segmented infected lung areas.
