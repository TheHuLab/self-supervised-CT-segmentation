\section{Methodology}


In this section, we will show the details of the self-supervised InfNet for imaging segmentation model including the network architecture, the data preprocessing steps, and the loss function. We will show how self-supervised InfNet helps to improve generalisation and performance of the model while having a limited number of data samples. We will also show the extension of our data preprocessing steps which further improves the performance of our model.

Supervised InfNet (Lung Infection Segmentation Network) will be used as our baseline to compare without using any semi-supervised learning algorithm. This is to show that the self-supervised learning method  improves the performance of the baseline supervised learning InfNet for imaging segmentation. We will extend our work on supervised InfNet by adding self-supervised method to it.

We will not change the structure of the InfNet model and use the default parameters as included in their GitHub code. There will be two different types of the InfNet model - single InfNet and multi InfNet. 

The single InfNet will create a single-labeled segmentation of the image for the infected region. The single InfNet predicts if the region is either ground-glass opacities or consolidations. It represents ground-glass opacities or consolidations as the same label. This means that the single InfNet will only predict the infected region without classifying them more specifically.  The CT lung image is first passed into the initial convolutional layers of the single InfNet to extract the features of the CT lung image. Then, the features generated from the convolutional layer are fed into the partial decoder module, reverse attention module and the edge detection module. The edge detection module is to help the network with detection of the boundaries of the segmentation. The reverse attention and the partial decoder generates the segmentation of the infection regions of the CT lung images.

The prediction from the single InfNet represent the infected region and will act as a prior to be fed into the multi InfNet. The prior will be concatenate with the original CT image to be fed into the multi InfNet network. The multi InfNet network will be used to predict multiple-labeled segmentation. The multiple-labeled segmentation includes predicting the background, ground-glass opacities, and consolidations for the infected region. The multiple-labeled segmentation model will give each of the label a different value instead of grouping them as one as what the single-segmentation model does.

\subsection{Self-supervised InfNet for imaging segmentation}

We will propose using a self-supervised method to improve the performance of deep neural networks to create pixel-level segmentation for CT scan for lung images of COVID-19 patients. We will integrate self-supervised inpainting to pre-train our network. Since image inpainting is similarly related to image segmentation, we will integrate the pre-training steps as image inpainting for our image segmentation network. 

The original InfNet model would generate 5 different predictions: the edge segmentation prediction, and the other 4 are segmentation of the infected regions but of different sizes. In order to utilise the ability of self-supervised method for InfNet segmentation, we generate masks to be fed into the InfNet model. The last convolution layer that outputs the prediction is not used for the self-supervised case. However, the last convolutional layer is replace with a different convolutional layer to reconstruct the image and the edge appropriately. Everything else is kept the same as the InfNet architecture. This way the network will learn meaningful representations of the CT images and we can use these meaningful representations to learn the segmentation of the infected regions of the CT lung images. After learning the self-supervised features for InfNet, the training continues as normal similar to the InfNet algorithm. The training will start with the weights trained using the self-supervised inpainting method. The last layer will be changed to its original layer instead of the replaced convolutional layer. 

By learning features from image inpainting, the model can learn more features that are related to image segmentation. As creating mask can be a complex task for the network to learn to inpaint, the mask can either be too complex for the network to start learning or too simple to be able to learn good representations. We will be using a coach network that increases the complexity of the masking of the CT images throughout the training of the network. The mask created will initially be relatively simple, once the network is able to predict the inpainting of the CT images with good performance, the coach will increase the complexity of the masking to reduce the performance of the network, similar to how Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) works. The loss for the coach network is constructed from the loss of the image inpainting from the InfNet. The coach network and the InfNet both work together as a MinMax algorithm. The InfNet will try and minimize the loss to generate better image inpainting while the coach network will try to increase the loss of the image inpainting through generating more complex masks. In the beginning, the masks generated by the coach network will be less complex. Through training of the coach network, as the InfNet gets better at predicting image inpainting, the coach network generates a more complex masks. The loss fuction for the coach network is:
\begin{equation}
L_{coach}(x) = 1 - L_{rec}(x\odot M)
\end{equation}

where $M = C(x)$ which is created by the coach network. A constraint is apply to this loss function because the coach network would just create a mask that masks all region because no context information would be present for the network to learn and a maximum loss will be achieved. The constraint is:
\begin{equation}
\hat{B}(x) = B(x) - SORT(B(x))^{k|B(x)} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
M = C(x) = \sigma (\alpha \hat{B}(x))
\end{equation}

The backbone, B, of the coach network has a similar network architecture with the model that inpaints the CT images. SORT(B(x)) sorts the features in descending order over the activation map. k represents the $k^{th}$ elements in the sorted list and k helps to control the fraction of the image to be erased. The region that has scores lesser than the $k^{th}$ element will be erased from the images. If k is 0.75 then 0.75 fraction of the images will not be erased. The score is scaled into a range of [0, 1] using a sigmoid activation function. We keep $\alpha = 1$ while training the coach network.

After the self-supervision training is finished, the single segmentation InfNet would reuse the self-supervised single InfNet network weights to train normally on the segmentation of the CT lung images. Likewise, the multi InfNet network would reuse the weights that were trained during self-supervised multi InfNet training to train normally on the segmentation of the CT lung images.

The proposed self-supervised single-labeled segmentation InfNet network architecture can be seen in \ref{fig:inf-net_arch}. The left side of the figure is the original Single InfNet architecture and the right side of the figure is the self-supervised Single InfNet. The last layer for each output prediction is replace to a different linear activation layer. The linear activation layer will re-create the original image that is covered by the masks. 

The proposed self-supervised multi-labeled segmentation InfNet network architecture is shown in \ref{fig:multi-inf-net_arch}. The changes in the architecture for the multi-labeled segmentation InfNet is similar to the single-labeled segmentation InfNet where the last layer of the layer is replace with a different linear actiivation layer to output the inpainting of the original image.

		\STATE save model weights, \textit{w}.
		\ENDFOR
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

We will also implement different data augmentation that includes random cropping, rotation, and random cutout to increase the number of available annotated data samples and labels as well as improve the model generalization as the data samples for CT images from COVID-19 can be limited. We will show that proper data augmentation affect the performance of the model by a marginal amount.

The output of the single segmentation InfNet will include the edge of the segmentation and four single-labeled segmentation of the infected region of the CT lung images with different sizes as shown in \ref{fig:supervised-inf-net_arch}. A loss will be calculated for each of the output from the single InfNet model. The first loss function is the loss edge, $L_{edge}$ which guides the model in representing better segmentation boundaries. The other loss function is the segmentation loss, ${L_{seg}}$. The segmentation loss combines both the loss of Intersection over Union (IoU) and the binary cross entropy loss. The segmentation loss equation for the single InfNet is as follows:
\begin{equation}
L_{seg} = L_{IoU} + \lambda L_{BCE}
\end{equation}

The $\lambda$ is set to 1 for this experiment. The segmentation loss is adapted to all of the ${S_i}$ predicted output where ${S_i}$ are created from $f_i$ such that $i={3,4,5}$. 

The total loss function for the single InfNet model is then:
\begin{equation}
L_{total} = L_{seg}(G_t, S_g) + L_{edge} + 	\sum_{i=3}^{5}L_{seg}(G_t, S_i)
\end{equation}

The summation of the loss functions are calculated from the output of the three convolutional layers. $G_t$ refers to the ground truth labels. $S_g$ is the output from the parallel partial decoder to match with the ground truth label.

As for the multiple segmentation infected region InfNet. We also use the default model and hypermaters from the InfNet code. We will however train the network without using any unlabeled images to be used as a supervised version. The CT lung images and prior (infected region) for the CT lung images are concatenate together before being fed into the multiple segmentation InfNet. The prior is generated from the single segmentation InfNet. The prior would contain the area of the infected region. However, the prior does not contain the labels for ground-glass opacities and consolidations. It just shows the infected regions. The multiple segmentation InfNet will label the CT lung images with background, ground-glass opacities, and consolidations. The architecture for multiple segmentation InfNet can be seen in \ref{fig:multi-inf-net_arch}. The loss function for the multiple segmentation InfNet is as follow:
\begin{equation}
L_{bce} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \cdot log(\hat{y_i}) + (1-y_i)\cdot log(1-\hat{y_i})
\end{equation}

The loss function for multiple segmentation InfNet uses the binary cross-entropy between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth segmentation.

In order to improve the performance of the model and to aid in the generalisation, we  determine to use self-supervised learning to learn good representations of the CT scan of lung images. Self-supervised learning generates auxiliary tasks from the labeled data samples. For instance, when undergoing data augmentation with rotation, we could train the network to predict if the images have been rotated 0 degree, 90 degree, 180 degree to learn representations of the images. 


\subsection{Estimation of Severity of COVID-19 from CT images}
Once the network is able to predict the pixel-level segmentation of the CT scan images, we will use the pre-trained network to predict the segmentation of the infected region. We will then calculate the ratio between the segmentation of the infected region and the segmentation of the parenchyma in the ICTCF dataset. We use the algorithm provided by ICTCF to split the parenchyma from the CT lung images. We manually remove images that the parenchyma were not splitted properly. There were 6654 images from 1338 patients. After cleaning the dataset, we ended up with 6613 CT lung images with properly splitted parenchyma. We will then calculate the ratio between the infected lung region predicted by our network with the splitted parenchyma from the CT lung images to determine the severity of the lung. The CT lung images is first fed into the single SInfNet networks to generate the infected region. The infected region will have the shape of the CT lung images. Each pixel of the predicted infected region represent the amount of infection that range from 0 to 1 where 0 is not infected and 1 is highly infected. We will add the sum of the predicted infected region and divide it by the area of the parenchyma to obtain the ratio. The higher the ratio between the infected region and the splitted parenchyma, the higher the severity of the lung.

%determine the severity score of the lung regions through several methods. The severity score of the lungs can be determined by using CT severity score (CT-SS) \cite{ref11}. The score uses lung opacification for extension of the infections in the lungs. CT-SS is an adaptation from the method previously used in patients after severe-acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) \cite{ref10} to describe ground-glass opacity, interstitial opacity, and air trapping. The lungs will be divided into 20 regions, the posterior apical segment of upper left lobe was divided into apical and posterior segmental regions, the anteromedial basal segment of lower left lobe will be divided into anterior and basal segmental regions. For each region, there contain a system attributing scores of 0, 1, 2, either parenchymal opacification involves 0%, less than 50%, or equal to or more than 50%. The CT-SS will calculate the sum of individual scored regions. The final value of CT-SS can range from 0 to 40.

The equation for the ratio calculation is as follows:

\begin{equation}
Ratio = \frac{\hat{y}}{P}
\end{equation}

Where $P$ refers to the area of the parenchyma region and $\hat{y}$ refers to the automatically segmented infected regions by the network.

We will compare our method against supervised and semi-supervised \cite{ref13,ref14} models trained on COVID-19 dataset. For comparing supervised learning, we will compare against the paper \cite{ref13}. We will train and follow using the same network structure but change from supervised learning to self-supervised learning and compare the performance between supervised and self-supervised.

When comparing with the semi-supervised model, we determine that our model is successful if our model is able to reach close to or better than the performance of the semi-supervised model as semi-supervised model is able to obtain a higher amount of data samples by looking at both unannotated and annotated data samples while self-supervised model only have access to the annotated labels. A self-supervised learning method will create its own training annotated labels without any manual human labelling and trained without any unlabeled data samples. We will compare our method’s performance against InfNet \cite{ref14} which uses semi-supervised learning by generating pseudo labels from randomly selected unlabeled CT images.

Our method will be novel compare to the other methods mentioned as our method will be integrating both the segmentation of the CT lung images as well as the calculation of the severity score through caluclation of the segmented infected lung areas.
