% "AB" then you have to do: "A\textbf{}\textbf{}B"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

		\noindent
		\textcolor{violet}{\textbf{ABSTRACT}} COVID-19 is the new outbreak of a contagious disease that infects the lungs. Currently, no vaccines or antiviral medicines exist for COVID-19 as COVID-19 is a new infectious disease that was first discovered around December 2019. As COVID-19 is a very contagious disease, cases appear faster than the amount of test kit available. Currently, the most common testing used is PCR(Polymerase Chain Reaction) test. These test samples are sent to a centralized lab for analysis which would take several days for the test results to be available. Due to the exponential rate of infections, the limited amount of test kits, and the long wait time for the test results to be available, many infected patients are unable to get tested and receive treatments. An alternative approach to test for COVID-19 patients is through computerized tomography (CT) scan of the lungs. CT scan can drastically reduce the time taken for test results to be available and this could speed up the testing time as well as the limiting number of testing kits available. We will propose a deep learning architecture that can evaluate different segmentation of the lungs from CT images to detect if a patient is infected with COVID-19 so that we can reduce the amount of time taken to carry out testing to determine if patients are infected with COVID-19. We will extend the work of InfNet and integrate self-supervised learning into InfNet to determine if there is a performance improvement. \\
