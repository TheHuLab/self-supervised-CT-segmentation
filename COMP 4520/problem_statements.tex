\section{Problem Statements}
The related works on segmentation for COVID-19 was trained on an abundant amount of annotated data samples of CT lung images. Getting a high performance in deep neural networks requires an abundant amount of annotated samples. Performance can be drastically reduced if there are not enough data samples to compensate for the modelâ€™s complexity. Likewise, complex data distributions to learn require a higher model complexity to be able to fit the distribution with better performance. As pixel-level segmentation on CT images is a complex task, pixel-level segmentation requires a high model complexity to fit the distribution. Unfortunately, there is a limited number of publicly available COVID-19 dataset especially in the form of pixel-level segmentation. The limited number of samples available greatly reduce the performance of modeling complex distribution for pixel-level segmentation of CT scans lung images.

The related work does not also consider the severity of the lungs of patients as a result from COVID-19. We will propose a model and technique that utilizes self-supervised learning to mitigate the limited number of publicly available COVID-19 CT lung images samples as well as a method to calculate severity score of the segmented regions of CT lung images.
