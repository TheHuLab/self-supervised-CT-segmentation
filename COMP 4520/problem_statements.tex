\section{Problem Statements}
There are several limitations in the related works described. First, getting a high performance in deep neural networks requires an abundant amount of annotated samples. Performance can be drastically reduced if there are not enough data samples to compensate for the modelâ€™s complexity. Second, learning complex data distributions require a higher model complexity to be able to fit the distribution with better performance. The related works utilize semi-supervised learning to increase the number of data samples to achieve higher performance. As pixel-level segmentation on CT images is a complex task, pixel-level segmentation requires a high model complexity to fit the distribution. Unfortunately, there is a limited number of publicly available COVID-19 datasets especially in the form of pixel-level segmentation. The limited number of samples available greatly reduces the performance of modeling complex distribution for pixel-level segmentation of CT scans lung images. 

To solve the challenges, We propose a model and technique that utilizes self-supervised learning to mitigate the limited number of publicly available COVID-19 CT lung images samples to segment the infected regions of CT lung images.
